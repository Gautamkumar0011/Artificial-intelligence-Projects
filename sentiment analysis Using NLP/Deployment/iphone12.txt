['\nSUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn\'t any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.PROS:1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn\'t have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.5.6. The dimensions of phone, it\'s smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.7.

Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery\'s health.2.

There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4.
